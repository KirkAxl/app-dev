> Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan. Set in a dystopian future where Earth is suffering from catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for mankind.
It was one of those science fiction movies that actually mirror some real life physics, the way they made this movie was almost accurate even at the smallest detail. It really touches how will things happen to humans in the vastness of space billions of kilometers away from home and show the will of humanity against impossible odds just to survive.
